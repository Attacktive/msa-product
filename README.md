It's a minimal example of a [microservice](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microservices) which manipulates the 'Products'.

Another microservice about 'Orders' can be found [here](https://github.com/Attacktive/msa-order).

## What It Does

- gets a product by the ID
- gets a list of products with pagination
- adds a product
- updates a product
- deletes a product

## Food for Thoughts

- updating and/or deleting a product that is already within an order might need... something.
